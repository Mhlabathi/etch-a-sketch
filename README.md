# etch-a-sketch

Using JS DOM Manipulation. This page resembles a sketch-pad.
Using a grid of divs that highlight a line through which the mouse moves on them and changes the color of each square div when hovered over it.

The button prompts the user to enter a number
This number(n) is used to create a grid of (n X n) grid squares without changing the width of the container div. 

For this initial release, it uses the flex-box and not the grid properties in the layout of the divs.
